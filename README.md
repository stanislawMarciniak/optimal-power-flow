A deep learning approach to solving AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problems using neural networks. This implementation provides fast, scalable solutions for power system optimization by approximating the complex, nonlinear relationships in electrical power grids.

## Overview

AC Optimal Power Flow is a fundamental optimization problem in power system operations that determines optimal generator settings while minimizing costs and satisfying operational constraints. Traditional optimization methods often struggle with the scale and complexity of modern power grids. This project leverages neural networks to provide rapid approximations of AC-OPF solutions.
