    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "AC-OPF is a fundamental problem in power system optimization, aimed at determining the optimal settings for generators and various control variables. The goal is to minimize operating costs while adhering to a range of operational constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rapidly evolving energy sector, the ability to quickly and efficiently solve the AC-OPF problem is becoming increasingly important. Faster and more scalable solutions enable real-time operational decisions and facilitate the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. Traditional methods, such as nonlinear programming, often struggle with the scale and complexity of modern power grids, leading to slower response times and potential inefficiencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, have introduced neural networks as a powerful alternative to traditional optimization methods. Neural networks can approximate complex, nonlinear functions, making them well-suited for modeling the intricacies of AC-OPF problems. By leveraging PyTorch, a leading deep learning framework, we can train neural networks to provide fast, scalable solutions for AC-OPF. This approach not only speeds up the computation but also enhances the ability to handle larger and more complex power grid systems.\n"
